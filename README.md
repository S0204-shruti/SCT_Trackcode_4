Key Features:
Task Input:
An input box (#inputBx) accepts user tasks. Tasks are added by pressing the "Enter" key.

Dynamic Task Addition:
On pressing Enter, the task is dynamically added to an unordered list (#list) as a <li> element.

Marking Tasks as Done:
Clicking a task toggles a .done class (to be styled in CSS), indicating it is completed.

Deleting Tasks:
Each task includes an empty <i> tag, which when clicked, removes the task from the list.

Clean UI Structure:
The structure is organized in a container and box div, and the layout is separated from logic using an external CSS file (style.css).
